# C964 - Computer Science Capstone - ASL_Classifier
This is the source code for my submission to WGU's computer science capstone, in the form of an interactive web app that can classify user-submitted images of American Sign Language (ASL). 

The model is Dockerized to an AWS ECR instance, and hosted on AWS Lambda to make the web app serverless and simple to implement. 

The web app can be accessed [here](https://epiliper.github.io/asl_classifier) 
 
For details on model training, check out the [notebook](./model.ipynb) included in this repository.
